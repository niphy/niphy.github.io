In the Shanghai Youth Science Innovation Practice, I assisted Li Ligang, a researcher to complete the project “Light Speed Measurement Based on Io eclipse”. At work, I surveyed the materials, planned and instructed students to conduct Io eclipse observations,  and taught the project to the high school students and assisted them to complete the project reports and papers.
