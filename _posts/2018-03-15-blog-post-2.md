Introduction
====

The Rubik's Cube is a toy that many people have played since childhood. They can exercise their children's hands-on ability and improve their memory and deduction ability.

Here is a cube that can customize the order.

Manipulations
====

The Rubik's cube implementation only supports keyboard operations, and can control a layer to rotate through U/D/L/R/B/F and numeric keys.

At the same time, the software can save or read the function of storing results. I hope you can explore it.

Of course I hope that you can participate in improving code efficiency, discussing and improving the design with your friends.

Source Codes
