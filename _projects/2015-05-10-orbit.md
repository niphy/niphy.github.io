Multi-body motion visualization driven by the EIH equation is implemented by OpenGL.

The trajectory of multiple satellite motions is obtained by the user inputting the initial satellite position and velocity, and integrating the Newton gravitation/first-order post-Newtonian gravity/EIH with the Rugger-Kutta7/8 integral.

At the same time, the user can control the angle of view and the observation tracking model through the keyboard/mouse/command line.

By setting special distance units (solar radius, astronomical unit, earth radius), and mass units (earth mass, solar mass), it is convenient for users to design satellite orbits.
