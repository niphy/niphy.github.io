Hi, everyone, I am very happy to meet everyone, thank you for your concern. I am currently studying for a doctorate in astronomy at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My Study during Ph.D
====

Study on Abel-Retrieved ionPrf with Occultation data
---
Retrieving the refractive index of the atmosphere based on occultation data to obtain its temperature and humidity is an old and long-lasting direction.However, the successful launch of more and more low-orbit satellites has made the ionospheric/atmospheric observations of low-orbit satellites extremely effective in their applications. It is an extremely important project to obtain high-precision ionospheric products through ground-based observation data to assist occult ionospheric observations, or to apply more occultation atmospheric observation data to meteorological data assimilation systems to improve the accuracy of meteorological forecasts.

Study on Global Ionospheric Assimilation Model
---
Ionospheric assimilation is a complex project, from data processing to inversion of results, involving a series of data flows. During my Ph.D., I mainly studied the following aspects of the ionosphere, such as its datas, methods, errors, and the DCBs of receivers and transmitters, which could be found at [Study on Global Ionospheric Assimilation Model](https://niphy.github.io/posts/2017/10/blog-post-3);

The study of the ionosphere is a dynamic direction, for the studies from meteorological data assimilation to finite element analysis of fluid mechanics have great guidance for ionospheric data assimilation. At the same time, the physical model of the ionosphere is continuously improved, assisting with data assimilation technology, and it is more ideal for the simulation/inversion of the ionosphere in the polar or complex environment.

Of course, the study of the ionospheric physical model and the ionospheric numerical model is a mutually competitive and mutually reinforcing development process.


My Interests on Artificial Intelligence, Computer Visualization, and etc..
===

Whether studying the surveying and mapping profession at the undergraduate level or studying astronomy at the master's level, there is a high demand for the use of computers. From data acquisition, data cleaning, to data processing and data visualization, the use of computers is very strict for these two branches of science which are extremely concerned about coordinates and position: large data processing, data quality control, high-precision model building, calculation time and space optimization, visualization of observations/model results in a variety of ways, and more.

Artificial intelligence is the most advanced data processing technology. Especially the successful application of neural network and deep learning algorithm in face recognition, image processing, security control, etc., indicates that weak artificial intelligence has achieved initial maturity. At the same time, data visualization, not only includes the trend display of sequence data/distribution data, the characterization of statistical data, but also the display of data in different coordinate systems and different applications. For example, satellite orbit data has great significance in planetary science, space science, meteorological science, and mapping. It is important to visualize it for satellite satellite characterization (satellite coverage, satellite return visit cycle) to guide these applications.The ionosphere/atmospheric occultation technique, as an interdisciplinary subject between earth science and space science, is essential for efficient computational algorithms and perfect visualization, so I have a deeper understanding of these aspects.
