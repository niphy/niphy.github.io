This paper describes the physical mechanisms, processes and basic calculation principle of the atmospheric inversion algorithm on the LEO-LEO radio occultation data, and analys a variety of error sources (such as clock errors, multipath and LEO satellite orbit errors, etc.) on the inversion results Impact. By statistics of the retrieval temperature and humidity, we found: the existing satellite clock stability and the LEO satellite orbit determination accuracy meet the needs of the occultation inversion; it is necessary to suppress high-amplitude, low-frequency noise on multipath effects. For LEO-LEO radio occultation, the data preprocessing and data inversion process optimization of the paper provides an important solution ideas and technology.
