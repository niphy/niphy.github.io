Study on Abel-Retrieved ionPrf with Occultation data
====

Retrieving the refractive index of the neutral atmosphere based on occultation data to obtain its temperature and humidity is an old and long-lasting direction.However, the successful launch of more and more low-orbit satellites has made the ionospheric/neutral atmospheric observations of low-orbit satellites extremely effective in their applications. It is an extremely important project to obtain high-precision ionospheric products through ground-based observation data to assist occult ionospheric observations, or to apply more occultation atmospheric observation data to meteorological data assimilation systems to improve the accuracy of meteorological forecasts.

Study on Global Ionospheric Assimilation Model
====
Ionospheric assimilation is a complex project, from data processing to inversion of results, involving a series of data flows. During my Ph.D., I mainly studied the following aspects of the ionosphere. (1). Data. (2). Method. (3). Errors. (4). The DCBs of receivers and transmitters. which at [Study on Global Ionospheric Assimilation Model](https://niphy.github.io/posts/2017/10/blog-post-3);

The study of the ionosphere is a dynamic direction, for the studies from meteorological data assimilation to finite element analysis of fluid mechanics have great guidance for ionospheric data assimilation. At the same time, the physical model of the ionosphere is continuously improved, assisting with data assimilation technology, and it is more ideal for the simulation/inversion of the ionosphere in the polar or complex environment.

Of course, the study of the ionospheric physical model and the ionospheric numerical model is a mutually competitive and mutually reinforcing development process.
